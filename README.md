# Hadoop-Multinode-Cluster-with-Zookeeper
Since manual failover mechanism was unable to automatically trigger a failover in cases of namenode failure, automatic failover mechanism made sure to provide a hot backup during a failover. This was overcome by zookeeper. We have already covered zookeeper installation &amp; configuration in my previous post. To configure an automatic failover ha cluster we need more than one odd number of nodes to ensure that always a majority of zookeeper servers are running in case of any namenode failure. We also need a running zookeeper ensemble..
